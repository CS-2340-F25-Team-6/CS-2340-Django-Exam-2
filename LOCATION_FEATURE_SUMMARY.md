# Location Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a location feature that asks for user location when creating profiles and purchasing movies. This location data is used to track and display trending movies by geographic area in the popularity map.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Profile with Location
- **Model**: Created `UserProfile` model in `accounts/models.py`
  - Links to Django's built-in User model
  - Stores state and country information
  - Automatically created when a user signs up

### 2. Enhanced Signup Process
- **Forms**: Updated `CustomUserCreationForm` in `accounts/forms.py`
  - Added state and country fields
  - Pre-filled with "United States" as default country
  - Includes helpful placeholder text for state field
- **Template**: Signup form automatically includes new location fields

### 3. Location-Aware Checkout Process
- **New View**: Added `checkout` view in `cart/views.py`
  - Displays order summary before purchase

### 4. Enhanced Order Model
- **Location Storage**: Order model already had state and country fields
- **Migration**: Applied existing migration to add location fields to database
- **Admin Interface**: Added UserProfile to admin for easy management

### 5. Real-Time Popularity Map
- **Dynamic Data**: Updated `popularitymap/views.py`
  - Pulls actual purchase data from orders with location
  - Groups by state and counts movie purchases
  - Sorts movies by popularity (purchase count)
  - Handles cases with no data gracefully

### 6. Template Filters
- **Cart Filters**: Added missing template filter for checkout functionality

4. User can immediately start shopping

### Shopping and Checkout
1. User adds movies to cart
2. Clicks "Checkout" (instead of "Purchase")
3. Reviews order summary
